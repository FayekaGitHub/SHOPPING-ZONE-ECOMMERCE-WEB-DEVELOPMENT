## ðŸ›’ Shopping Zone
Welcome to Shopping Zone, a eCommerce platform designed for an exceptional online shopping experience.
This dynamic application is built using ReactJS, with HTML structuring the content and CSS ensuring a responsive and visually engaging design.
The platform leverages Context API in conjunction with reducers to manage global state efficiently. 
Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to manually pass props down at every level, ensuring that all parts of the application can access and update the global state seamlessly. Reducers work in tandem with Context API to handle complex state transitions in a predictable manner, encapsulating the logic for updating the state based on dispatched actions. This combination allows Shopping Zone to maintain a smooth and consistent user experience. The application also integrates the DummyJSON API to fetch real-time product data, enhancing the dynamic nature of the platform. Key features include secure Login & Logout functionalities, intuitive Cart Management with detailed invoices, Search Bar and Filters for efficient product discovery, and comprehensive views for Product and Order Details.
